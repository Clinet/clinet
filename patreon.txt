Say hello to **Clinet+**, the new best way to support Clinet's development!

It's been over four years since Clinet was launched on Discord (October 27th, 2017), and in that time every feature under Clinet's toolbelt has been provided to you for free. It's had low operating costs for most of the run, but recent revelations have led to the need to begin making enough to support Clinet's continued usage, development, and maintenance. Otherwise, we run the risk of being unable to give it the development attention it deserves, and I'd rather not have to put Clinet on hiatus and in a future unstable state. This is your chance to show me your support for Clinet and to help it continue growing in features and scale!

**The following benefits will be granted to you after you subscribe:**

• You'll be able to direct message <@!374546169755598849> with your commands and queries instead of having to use a server
***And more to be added at a later date!***
