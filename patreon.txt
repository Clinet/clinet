Say hello to **Clinet+**, the new best way to support Clinet's development!

It's been over four years since Clinet was launched on Discord (October 27th, 2017), and in that time every feature under Clinet's toolbelt has been provided to you for free. It's had minimal operating costs for most of the run, but recent revelations have led to the decision to either begin profiting off of Clinet's continued usage or risk being unable to give it the development attention it deserves. I'd rather not have to put Clinet on hiatus and in a future unstable state, so this is your chance to show me your support for the bot and to help it continue to grow!
